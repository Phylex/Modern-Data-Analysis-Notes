    "## Mathematical formulation of Probability\n",
    "As many things in mathematics Statistics is based on set theort. Subsequently all quantities are described via Sets.\n",
    "Let's consider some hypothetical experiment. The different states of the Experiment are illustrated below.\n",

    "<img src=\"graphics/Probabilities.svg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's also assume, that all possible outcomes of the experiment are known (the experiment may be a dice throw where there are only 6 possible outcomes if we assume it is a 6 sided dice ( and, well, if we disregard the exact position that the dice ends up in after the throw, but for most games it is irrelevant where the dice ends up (maybe under the table?) as long as the number shown can be read).\n",
    "Then $S$ is the state space of all possible outcomes of the experiment. As $A$ and $B$ lie within $S$ they are subsets of $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As all possible outcomes are contained in $S$ from which follows $P(S) = 1$, so in the frequentist interpretation is that the every measured quantity lies in $S$, or in bayesian interpretation the statement, \"all measurements lie within $S$\" is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most part, when looking at experiments, the frequentist interpretation is a bit more helpful which is why focus is placed on this interpretation for now.\n",
    "As for $A$ and $B$, as both are subsets of $S$ it can be deduced that $P(A) < P(S)$ and $P(B) < P(S)$, as both $A \\subset S$ and $B \\subset S$ (note that they are proper subsets).\n",
    "\n",
    "If it is of interest that the experiments produces a result that is either in $A$ or in $B$ and they satisfy $A \\cup B = \\emptyset$ (as shown in the illustration above) then it can be shown that $P(A\\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$\n",
    "\n",
    "These three traits are know as the **Kolmogorov Axioms** and are written more concicely in the table below\n",
