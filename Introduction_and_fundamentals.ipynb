    "## Introduction\n",
    "The goal of Data analysis is always to extract Information from Data. Some pieces of Information will stand out immediately\n",
    "(for example if a Value appears very often in the data set that will be noticable without the aid of staistical tools)\n",
    "but most of the information has to be extracted via analytical procedures. In this context the information that can be\n",
    "extracted from the data will be a model of the process that generated the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Model will have a specific form (an exponential decay for example), that most often will have to be infered from the experience of the\n",
    "person analyzing the Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be more precise, a model is a function of some set of input parameters $\\vec{\\theta}$ and of a set\n",
    "of observables $\\vec{x}$ that produce the \"true\" value(s) $\\vec{y} = f(\\vec{x}, \\vec{\\theta})$ that when combined with uncertainties\n",
    "produce the observed data $\\vec{x}$.\n",
    "These fluctuations arise either from (ramdom) fluctuations (that sometimes by their very nature cannot be suppressed) of the\n",
    "quantities of interest ($\\vec{x}$), or of noise and other sideeffects that are part of the measuring process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every Measurement will have some amount of uncertainty associated with it (remember that we are actually all just big interference phenomenons\n",
    "when viewed from a quantum mechanical perspective) as we are allways measuring processes that are by there very nature statistical.\n",
    "Furthermore the Instruments themselves are quantummechanical objects that are subject to the same random behaviour that causes fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are models that by their very nature can approximate any underlying function (for example a fourier series), these methods are however\n",
    "mostly avoided, because the calculations involved are very time consuming and don't present the result in a way that is understandable for\n",
    "humans (Do you know the coeficients of the fourier series for an exponential decay? Well I definitely don't) even if the result can be made\n",
    "arbitrarily accurate and the situation where \"the model is wrong\" can always be avoided."

    "## The role of Statistics in Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, most often we are dealing with systems that are either to complex to be accurately modeled in detail (the stock market would come to mind)\n",
    "or that by their very nature are statistical (i.e involve some sort of randomness)."

    "#### Assumptions for complex systems\n",
    "The reason that we can not only model truly random processes (like quantum mechanics) but also highly complex models is the assumption, that in highly complex\n",
    "models small fluctuations only cause small effects, which seems to hold true for the most part (and for further information please consult your local chaos theorist).\n",
    "So if the small fluctuations are assumed to be random, the resulting behaviour is still mostly dependent on the main \"forces\" acting on the system because small random fluctuations are still small and will only have a small effect. These small effects then add up to the uncertainty of the prediction based on the more coarse model.\n",

    "As randomness is involved in the processes the mathematical methods of the field of statistics (the study of random quantities) can be applied to gain information from Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics offers a wide range of procedures and definitions that can be used to reproducably and repeatedly gain information from data.\n",
    "In this specific case we would like a model ($\\vec{y} = f(\\vec{x},\\vec{\\theta})$) that describes the data. The model therefor represents *information*.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we are dealing with statistical processes we can not make certain claims, but must use probabilities in stead.\n",
    "Another problem that can easily be overlooked when only taking a superficial look at statistical analysis, is that most statements are not\n",
    "clearly Yes or No but are far more often something inbetween. This thing inbetween is called the Probability.\n",
    "The concept of probability allows for a far more nuanced view of the data. It allows to weigh different options against each other using the probability as\n",

    "As you may have noticed I am making the distiction between Data and information. I am doing so to avoid the seemingly common confusion of both. For this set of documents data allways means the raw measurements. There is a LOT of data out there. The problem with data is obvious when considering the following example: \n",
    "\n",
    "I give you 400,000 pages of rows and rows of numbers that describe the process that you are to become an expert on. Even though you have \"all the data\" you don't have an *understanding* (i.e Informationn), you can't *predict* anything based on the Data alone . You job is to *make sense* of all these numbers, to find the *patterns* in\n",
    "the Data, thus deriving information from all of these rows and columns.\n",
    "As you may see now, information is closely related to understanding and therefor to something we humans can comprehend and act upon or think about. Data on the other hand is only a vast quantity of numbers.\n",

Both interpretations of Probability will be used depending on the circumstances, so they don't exclude but complement themselves."

    "In the bayesian interpretation of Probability views statements as either true or false and interprets probability as a degree of belief in that statement.\n",
    "I think it is important to note that the type of statements that are normally used in combination with the bayesian interpretation are relatively basic.\n",
    "This is a consequence of the quickly declining probability of multiple events that are interdependent and have to occurr in a precice order, to make a complex\n",
